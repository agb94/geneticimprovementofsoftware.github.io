We are happy to announce that [Myra B. Cohen](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/mcohen/) (Iowa State University, USA) will give the keynote speech in GI@ICSE 20223.

Prof. Cohen is a full professor at Iowa State University (USA), where she holds the Lanh and Oanh Nguyen Chair in Software Engineering in the Department of Computer Science.
She is head of Iowa State's LaVA-Ops, Laboratory for Variability-Aware Assurance and Testing of Organic Programs.
As well as genetic improvement, her research covers software testing of highly-configurable software, SBSE, applications of combinatorial designs (CIT), and the synergy between systems and synthetic biology and software engineering.
She has served on many software engineering conferences, including this year as the Technical Briefings-track chair of ICSE 2023.

## <a name="CFP"></a> Call For Submissions [[pdf]({{ "/paper_pdfs/gi2023icse/call_for_papers.pdf" | relative_url }})]

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement.
The International Workshop on Genetic Improvement is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas, and discover new research directions.
Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement. Applications of GI include, but are not limited to:
- Improve efficiency
- Decrease memory consumption
- Decrease energy consumption
- Transplant new functionality
- Specialise software
- Translate between programming languages
- Generate multiple versions of software
- Improve low level or binary code
- Repair bugs
- GI techniques in industrial settings

We invite submissions of two paper types:
- Research papers (eight page limit, *excluding* references)
- Position papers (two page limit, including references)

The **<i class="fas fa-award"></i> best paper** and **<i class="fas fa-award"></i> best presentation** will be awarded during the workshop.

Detailed formatting instructions for authors are listed [here](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2023/icse-2023-technical-track#_88zkfa4v30vp).  
We encourage authors to submit early and in-progress work.
The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion.

Papers must be submitted through the paper submission website: [https://gi-at-icse2023-workshop.hotcrp.com/](https://gi-at-icse2023-workshop.hotcrp.com/)  
These papers will be reviewed in a double-blind manner.  
All accepted papers must be presented at the workshop.


## <a name="bursaries"></a> Funding Opportunity For Students

We will support up to 5 students by offering to partially reimburse (up to 200 GBP each) registration and travel costs for students whose work is accepted to the GI workshop.
Priority will be given based on the student’s need and submission quality.

Students applying for a scholarship should submit a first-author regular paper to the workshop (up to 8 pages long) and plan to present their work in Melbourne in person.
Moreover, their supervisor should send a one-paragraph note of recommendation to [v.nowack@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:v.nowack@imperial.ac.uk) listing:
- the student’s area of work.
- the supervisor’s support of the student’s application.
