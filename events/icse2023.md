> **It’s all in the Semantics: When are Genetically Improved Programs Still Correct?**  
> _Genetic improvement (GI) is a powerful technique to automatically optimize programs, often for non-functional properties.  As such, we expect to retain the original program semantics, hence GI is guided by both a functional test suite and at least one other objective such as program efficiency, memory usage, energy efficiency, etc. An assumption made is that it is possible to improve a program’s non-functional objective while retaining the program’s correctness, however, this assumption may not hold for all types of non-functional properties.  In this talk I show why GI is naturally a multi-objective optimization problem and argue that it may be necessary to relax part of the program correctness to satisfy our non-functional goals. I discuss a few recent examples where we have had to balance functional correctness and non-functional objectives and demonstrate how this may lead to programs that are of higher quality in the end. This raises an important question about when it is possible to completely satisfy multiple (potentially competing) program objectives during GI, and when it is semantically impossible. This leads to the ultimate question of what it means for a program to be correct when using GI._

Prof. Cohen is a full professor at Iowa State University (USA), where she holds the Lanh and Oanh Nguyen Chair in Software Engineering in the Department of Computer Science.
She is head of Iowa State's LaVA-Ops, Laboratory for Variability-Aware Assurance and Testing of Organic Programs.
As well as genetic improvement, her research covers software testing of highly-configurable software, SBSE, applications of combinatorial designs (CIT), and the synergy between systems and synthetic biology and software engineering.
She has served on many software engineering conferences, including this year as the Technical Briefings-track chair of ICSE 2023.

"Generative Art via Grammatical Evolution" 
by Erik M. Fredericks, Abigail C. Diller, Jared M. Moore (all at Grand Valley State University)
</summary>
Abstract: 
Generative art produces artistic output via algorithmic design. Common examples include flow fields, particle motion, and mathematical formula visualization. Typically an art piece is generated with the artist/programmer acting as a domain expert to create the final output. A large amount of effort is often spent manipulating and/or refining parameters or algorithms and observing the resulting changes in produced images. Small changes to parameters of the various techniques can substantially alter the final product. We present GenerativeGI, a proof of concept evolutionary  framework for creating generative art based on an input suite of artistic techniques and desired aesthetic preferences for outputs. GenerativeGI encodes artistic techniques in a grammar, thereby enabling multiple techniques to be combined and optimized via a many-objective evolutionary algorithm. Specific combinations of evolutionary objectives can help refine outputs reflecting the aesthetic preferences of the designer. Experimental results indicate that GenerativeGI can successfully produce more visually complex outputs than those found by random search.

"Updating Gin’s profiler for current Java" by Alexander Brownlee (University of Stirling), Myles Watkinson (University of Adelaide)
</summary>
Abstract: Genetic improvement is a young and growing field. With much research still to be done, a number of tools to support the research community have emerged, with Gin being one such tool targeted at GI for Java.

One core component of Gin is the profiler, which is used to identify ‘hot’ methods in target applications: methods where the CPU spends most time and so may offer the most fertile sections of code for improvements to run time. Gin’s profiler is HPROF, which was included with JDKs up to version 8. HPROF is no longer supported and so needs replaced if Gin is to support later versions of Java. Furthermore, little investigation has been made within the GI community comparing different profiling approaches.

With this paper and its associated & accepted pull request, we replace Gin’s CPU profiler to allow Gin to be applied to current Java code.

"Genetic Improvement of OLC and H3 with Magpie" by William B. Langdon (University College London, Brad Alexander (University of Adelaide/Industry)
</summary>
Abstract: Magpie (Machine Automated General Performance Improvement via Evolution of software) has been recently developed by Aymeric Blot from PyGGI 2.0.  Like PyGGI, it claims to be able to optimise computer source code written in arbitrary programming languages.  So far it has been demonstrated on benchmarks written in Python and C.  Recently we have used hill climbing to improve intermediate code (IR) generated by the LLVM Clang C/C++ compiler for two industrial open source programs (Google's Open Location Code OLC and Uber's Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index (H3).  Magpie found much faster improvements (reducing instruction counts by up to 15 percent versus 2 percent) which generalise.  Various glitches in Magpie are also reported.

"DebugNS: Novelty Search for Finding Bugs in Simulators" by David Griffin (University of York), Susan Stepney (University of York), Ian Vidamour (University of Sheffield)
</summary>
Abstract: Novelty search is used to find a range of novel behaviours in a system. Software bugs are behaviours that are a) unexpected and b) incorrect. As the intersection between ``novel'' and ``unexpected'' is non-empty, here we overview how novelty search can be employed to find bugs in simulation software. We give an example of this approach applied to the RingSim simulator.

Exploring the Use of Natural Language Processing Techniques for Enhancing
"Genetic Improvement" by Oliver Krauss (University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria)
</summary>
Abstract: We explore the potential of using large-scale Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, such as GPT-3, for enhancing genetic improvement in software development These models have previously been used to automatically find bugs, or improve software. We propose utilizing these models as a novel mutator, as well as for explaining the patches generated by genetic improvement algorithms. Our initial findings indicate promising results, but further research is needed to determine the scalability and applicability of this approach across different programming languages.

"Towards Objective-Tailored Genetic Improvement Through Large Language Models" by Sungmin Kang, Shin Yoo (both at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)
</summary>
Abstract: While Genetic Improvement (GI) is a useful paradigm to improve functional and nonfunctional aspects of software, existing techniques tended to use the same set of mutation operators for differing objectives, due to the difficulty of writing custom mutation operators. In this work, we suggest that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to generate objective-tailored mutants, expanding the possibilities of software optimizations that GI can perform. We further argue that LLMs and the GI process can benefit from the strengths of one another, and present a simple example demonstrating that LLMs can both improve the effectiveness of the GI optimization process, while also benefiting from the evaluation steps of GI. As a result, we believe that the combination of LLMs and GI has the capability to significantly aid developers in optimizing their software.
