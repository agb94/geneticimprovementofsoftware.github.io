We are happy to announce that [Stephanie Forrest](https://forrest.biodesign.asu.edu/index.html) (Arizona State University) will give the keynote speech in GI@ICSE 2021: **Engineering and Evolving Software**.  
The keynote will be less a reflection of 'where the genetic improvement field is today' than putting the micro-level evolution we design for single programs into a larger context of software engineering practice which is inadvertently using evolution at the macro-scale.
She hopes also to encourage GI practitioners to start thinking more about evolutionary search rather than focusing so much on designing better mutation operators.

Prof. Stephanie Forrest works at Arizona State University, where she directs the [Biodesign Center for Biocomputation, Security and Society](https://biodesign.asu.edu/Research/Centers/biocomputing-security-and-society) in the School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Sciences Engineering (CIDSE).
Forrest studies the biology of computation and the computation of biology, including work on computational immunology, computer security, automated software repair, evolutionary computation, and biological modeling.

## <a name="CFP"></a> Call For Submissions [[pdf]({{ "/paper_pdfs/gi2021icse/call_for_papers.pdf" | relative_url }})]

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement.
The International Workshop on Genetic Improvement is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas, and discover new research directions.
Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement. Applications of GI include, but are not limited to:

- Improve efficiency
- Decrease memory consumption
- Decrease energy consumption
- Transplant new functionality
- Specialise software
- Translate between programming languages
- Generate multiple versions of software
- Repair bugs

We invite submissions of two paper types:
- Research papers (eight page limit, including references)
- Position papers (two page limit, including references)

We encourage authors to submit early and in-progress work.
The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion.

All papers should be submitted via HotCRP: [https://icse21-gi10.hotcrp.com/](https://icse21-gi10.hotcrp.com/)

These papers will be reviewed in a double-blind manner. PDFs should therefore be anonymized prior to submission.
The [IEEE conference format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) should be utilized with title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type.  LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the `compsoc` or `compsocconf` options). Please check the [ICSE 2021 submission information page](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-papers#how-to-submit) for more information on paper formatting.


Please also consult the [ICSE 2021 Q&A page](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-submitting-to-icse2021--q-a) on double blind submissions.

All accepted papers must be presented at GI-2021 and will appear in the ICSE workshops volume.
