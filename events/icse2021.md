## <a name="CFP"></a> Call For Submissions [[pdf](/paper_pdfs/gi2020icse/call_for_papers.pdf)]

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement.
GI is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas and discover new research directions.
Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement. Applications include, but are not limited to, using GI to:
- Improve efficiency
- Decrease memory consumption
- Decrease energy consumption
- Transplant new functionality
- Specialise software
- Translate between programming languages
- Generate multiple versions of software
- Repair bugs


## Research & Position Papers

We invite submissions of two types of paper:
- Research papers (limit eight pages)
- Position papers (limit two pages)

We encourage authors to submit early and in-progress work.
The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion.


All papers should be submitted via HotCRP: (TBD)
double-blind as PDFs (in the [IEEE conference format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) as per the [ICSE 2021 information](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-papers#how-to-submit): title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the `compsoc` or `compsocconf` options).
See also the ICSE 2021 [Q&A page](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-submitting-to-icse2021--q-a) on double blind submissions.

All accepted papers must be presented at GI-2021 and will appear in the ICSE workshops volume.
The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available online.


## Studentships

There will be up to five student travel scholarships available.
