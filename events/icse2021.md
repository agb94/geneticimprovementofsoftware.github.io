papers:
- title: Using Genetic Improvement to Synthesise Quantum Programs on Differing Hardware
  authors:
  - George O'Brien
  - John Clark
  abstract: "Quantum computers are rapidly developing to a point where they can solve problems faster than any classical computation. As they're developed competing standards for languages, models and architectures are also being created. These standards are often bespoke and aimed at optimizing around a single algorithm or problem. This can make it very difficult to reuse these them should the original hardware become unavailable or obsolete. We demonstrate a method that can compile circuits more generally across hardware constraints with the use of a genetic improvement inspired search technique that includes a realistic model of the hardware. We show that this method is effective at selecting gates that can be more easily implemented and ran compared to generic optimization which reduces the total chance of failure. To ensure that these results are practical, empirical results are generated using different IBM hardware and a selection of real algorithms."
- title: Open Challenges in Genetic Improvement for Emergent Software Systems
  authors:
  - Penelope Faulkner Rainford
  - Barry Porter
  abstract: "Genetic improvement for emergent software systems faces unique challenges due to its deployment in highly dynamic environments. In this paper we discuss four of those challenges along with our initial plans for new research."
- title: Applying Automated Program Repair to Dataflow Programming Languages
  authors:
  - Yu Huang
  - Hammad Ahmad
  - Stephanie Forrest
  - Westley Weimer
  abstract: "Dataflow programming languages are used in a variety of settings, and defects in their programs can have serious consequences. However, prior work in automated program repair (APR) emphasizes control flow over dataflow languages. We identify three impediments to the use of APR in dataflow programming---parallelism, state, and evaluation---and highlight opportunities for overcoming them."
- title: "CRNRepair: Automated Program Repair of Chemical Reaction Networks"
  authors:
  - Ibrahim Mesecan
  - Michael C. Gerten
  - James I. Lathrop
  - Myra B. Cohen
  - Tomas Haddad Caldas
  abstract: "Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are abstractions of distributed networks that form the foundations of many natural phenomena such as biological processes. These can be encoded and/or compiled into DNA and have been shown to be Turing complete. Before CRNs are implemented in a physical environment, they are often simulated in programming environments. Like traditional programs, these CRN programs must be validated. Researchers have recently designed a software testing framework for CRNs, however, repairing CRN programs is still a manual task. While the programs are often small in size, finding and repairing the faults can be difficult without automated support. In this paper we present CRNRepair, a program repair framework for CRN programs. We built our framework on top of an existing APR framework. We use a testing infrastructure built in the Matlab SimBiology package and adapt it to use the SBML representation for its abstract syntax tree. In a case study on 19 mutant versions of 2 programs, we find plausible patches for 90% of one of the programs, and 50% of the other. We find several common types of repairs, which differ from the correct programs, but are functionally correct."
- title: Generating Objected-Oriented Source Code Using Genetic Programming
  authors:
  - Vicente Illanes
  - Alexandre Bergel
  abstract: "Using machine learning to generate source code is an active and highly important research area. It has been shown that genetic programming (GP) efficiently contributes to software repair. However, most of the published advances on applying GP to generate source code are limited to the C programming language.

This paper explores the use of genetic programming to generate objected oriented source code in a dynamically-typed setting. We found that GP is able to produce missing one-line statements with a precision of 51%. Our preliminary results contributes to the state of the art by indicating that GP may be effectively employed to generate source code for dynamically-typed object-oriented applications."
- title: Optimising SQL Queries Using Genetic Improvement
  authors:
  - James Callan
  - Justyna Petke
  abstract: "Structured Query Language (SQL) queries are ubiquitous in modern software engineering. These queries can be costly when run on large databases with many entries and tables to consider. We propose using Genetic Improvement (GI) to explore patches for these queries, with the aim of optimising their execution time, whilst maintaining the functionality of the program in which they are utilised. Specifically, we propose three ways in which SQL JOIN statements can be mutated in order to improve performance. We also discuss the requirements of software being improved in this manner and the potential challenges of our approach."
- title: (Genetically) Improving Novelty in Procedural Story Generation
  authors:
  - Erik Fredericks
  - Byron DeVries
  abstract: "Procedural story generation tailors a unique narrative experience for a player and can be accomplished via multiple techniques, from matching storylets to grammar-based generation. This paper describes a conceptual procedure for applying genetic improvement to a grammar-driven procedural narrative within the context of a browser-based game."
- title: Partial Specifications for Program Repair
  authors:
  - Linsey Kitt
  - Myra B. Cohen
  abstract: "In this paper we argue for using many partial test suites instead of one full test suite during program repair. This may provide a pool of simpler, yet correct patches, addressing both the overfitting and poor repair quality problem. To support this idea, we present some insight obtained running APR partial test suites on the well studied triangle program."
- title: "Uniform Edit Selection for Genetic Improvement: Empirical Analysis of Mutation Operator Efficacy"
  authors:
  - Marta Smigielska
  - Aymeric Blot
  - Justyna Petke
  abstract: "Genetic improvement (GI) tools find improved program versions by modifying the initial program. These can be used for the purpose of automated program repair (APR). GI uses software transformations, called \textit{mutation operators}, such as deletions, insertions, and replacements of code fragments. Current edit selection strategies, however, under-explore the search spaces of insertion and replacement operators. Therefore, we implement a uniform strategy based on the relative operator search space sizes. We evaluate it on the QuixBugs repair benchmark and find that the uniform strategy has the potential for improving APR tool performance. We also analyse the efficacy of the different mutation operators with regard to the type of code fragment they are applied to. We find that, for all operators, choosing expression statements as target statements is the most successful for finding program variants with improved or preserved fitness (50.03%, 33.12% and 23.85% for deletions, insertions and replacements, respectively), whereas choosing declaration statements is the least effective (3.16%, 10.82% and 3.14% for deletions, insertions and replacements)."

- title: "Exploring the Accuracy - Energy Trade-off in Machine Learning"
  authors:
  - Alexander E.I. Brownlee
  - Jason Adair
  - Saemundur O. Haraldsson
  - John Jabbo
  abstract: "Machine learning accounts for considerable global electricity demand and resulting environmental impact, as training a large deep-learning model produces 284 000kgs of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. In recent years, search-based approaches have begun to explore improving software to consume less energy. Machine learning is a particularly strong candidate for this because it is possible to trade off functionality (accuracy) against energy consumption, whereas with many programs functionality is simply a pass-or-fail constraint. We use a grid search to explore hyperparameter configurations for a multilayer perceptron on five classification data sets, considering trade-offs of classification accuracy against training or inference energy. On one data set, we show that 77% of energy consumption for inference can saved by reducing accuracy from 94.3% to 93.2%. Energy for training can also be reduced by 30-50% with minimal loss of accuracy. We also find that structural parameters like hidden layer size is a major driver of the energy-accuracy trade-off, but there is some evidence that non-structural hyperparameters influence the trade-off too. We also show that a search-based approach has the potential to identify these trade-offs more efficiently than the grid search."
- title: A Permutation Representation of Covering Arrays
  authors:
  - Ryan Dougherty
  - Xi Jiang
  abstract: "Testing a large-scale system requires understanding how each of the components interact with each other, which is the subject of interaction testing. Covering arrays are a well-studied object, but ``traditional'' representations of these arrays in the context of genetic algorithms has not yielded much success. We propose a new representation of covering arrays based on a permutation of the rows considered. Preliminary results for reducing the mean-time-to-failure of these arrays are given."
