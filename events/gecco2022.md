We are happy to announce that [Westley Weimer](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/) (University of Michigan, USA) will give the keynote speech in GI@GECCO 2022.

Prof. Westley Weimer received his PhD from the University of California at Berkeley.
His research interests include reducing the costs associated with software development at scale (particularly through automated program repair) as well as program analysis, formal verification, and human linguistic and visual interaction with software.
He is a senior member of the Association for Computing Machinery and his work has led to over fifteen thousand citations and several awards, including three ‘Humies’ and ICSE 2019 Most Influential paper for his work on using Genetic Improvement for bug fixing.


## <a name="CFP"></a> Call For Submissions [[pdf]({{ "/paper_pdfs/gi2022gecco/call_for_papers.pdf" | relative_url }})]

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement.
The International Workshop on Genetic Improvement is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas, and discover new research directions.
Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement. Applications of GI include, but are not limited to:

- Improve efficiency
- Decrease memory consumption
- Decrease energy consumption
- Transplant new functionality
- Specialise software
- Translate between programming languages
- Generate multiple versions of software
- Repair bugs

We invite submissions of two paper types:
- Research papers (eight page limit, *excluding* references)
- Position papers (two page limit, including references)

The **<i class="fas fa-award"></i> best paper** and **<i class="fas fa-award"></i> best presentation** will be awarded during the workshop.

Detailed formatting instructions for authors are listed [here](https://gecco-2022.sigevo.org/Paper-Submission-Instructions).  
We encourage authors to submit early and in-progress work.
The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion.

Papers must be submitted through the paper submission website: [https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/gecco/](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/gecco/)  
These papers will be reviewed in a double-blind manner.  
All accepted papers must be presented at GI-2022 and will appear in the GECCO companion volume.

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies ([https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc)), including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects ([https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects)).


## <a name="bursaries"></a> Funding Opportunity For Students

We will offer up to 5 scholarships to partially cover (up to $200 each) registration and travel costs for GECCO and all associated workshops for students whose work is accepted to the GI workshop.
Priority will be given based on the student’s need and submission quality.

Students applying for a scholarship should submit a first-author regular paper to the workshop (up to 8 pages long) and plan to present their work in Boston in person.
Moreover, their supervisor should send a one-paragraph note of recommendation to [bbruce@ucdavis.edu](mailto:bbruce@ucdavis.edu) listing:
- the student’s area of work.
- the supervisor’s support of the student’s application.
