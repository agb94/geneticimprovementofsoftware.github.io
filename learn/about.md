## What is Genetic Improvement?

Genetic Improvement is the application of evolutionary and search-based optimisation methods to the improvement of existing software.
It has been used to improve both software functional properties, such as fixing bug or performing automated code transplantation, and software non-functional properties, such as minimising execution time, memory usage, or energy consumption.


## The GI workshops

As academics in the field, we run the workshop to offer an opportunity for researchers to disseminate work, but most importantly to meet and discuss with other GI researchers.
So far we had ten editions of the workshop, six co-located with GECCO (in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020) and four with ICSE (in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021).

Details on all previous workshop papers can be found [here](../events/papers).


## How can I find out more?

We have other [regular events](../events/gi) year-round, including tutorials in conferences such as GECCO, ASE, or PPSN.

Check out the 2018 [comprehensive survey](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7911210) on GI, as well as our [living survey](survey) for even more related work.
