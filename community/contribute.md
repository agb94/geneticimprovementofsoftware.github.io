## Contributing

This is a _community_ website on Genetic Improvement.  
In practice this means two things:
first, that no single person is really responsible for maintaining it, especially regarding pages that are by nature incomplete (e.g., the [list of GI tools]({{ "/use/tools" | relative_url }} or the [living survey]({{ "/learn/survey" | relative_url }})) or potentially subjective (e.g., the [GI success stories]({{ "/learn/success" | relative_url }})).
And second, that anyone, from student to professor, from researcher to practitioner, is _very_ welcome to contribute improving it.


## Examples of contributions

Even the smallest of contribution will help the website and through it help the GI field altogether.
While not limited to the following, do not hesitate to:
- fix typos or small visual bugs,
- report dead links or missing images,
- rephrase, rewrite, or update content,
- improve or fix the general design (especially for mobile devices).


## How to contribute

This website is hosted on GitHub pages on a public repository: [https://github.com/geneticimprovementofsoftware/geneticimprovementofsoftware.github.io]().
From there you can easily open [issue tickets](https://github.com/geneticimprovementofsoftware/geneticimprovementofsoftware.github.io/issues), fork the repository, and submit [pull requests](https://github.com/geneticimprovementofsoftware/geneticimprovementofsoftware.github.io/pulls).  
Alternatively, you can directly [contact us]({{ "/community/website" | relative_url }}).

In practice, GitHub pages internally uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which in turn uses [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki).
Once forked, you can edit the website _simply_ by installing Ruby and the `jekyll` and `jekyll-seo-tag` gems.
Once installed, you can host the website locally by running `$ jekyll serve` from a terminal and visiting (presumably) the address [http://127.0.0.1:4000/geneticimprovementofsoftware/]().
Note that committing changes to GitHub will lead to a CNAME related page build warning email; this is a normal and expected result.
